# Mighty Minds React Project

Could not finish the project on time. I've only manage to create the Responsive navbar and Header. Struggled with Material UI, lots of changes on their latest update just weeks ago. Had to read lots of docs and also their Grid and Flexbox system is a bit weird, took me a lot of time adjusting the responsiveness.
